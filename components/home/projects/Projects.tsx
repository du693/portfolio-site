			"Currently, the job scraper is local python web scraper that compiles results from popular job boards and displays them in a Flask application. I made this project because navigating through each individual job board was taking up loads of time that I could be using to apply to positions and studying. I figured that this project would not only make the job searching process more efficient but also further develop my skills with Python and app development. While the app is still a work in progress I have already started using and loving it. ",
